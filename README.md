project for fingertip music

This is a fingertip interactive music system, enabling users to compose and play with music in a pretty easy and natural way: hand and finger movement in 3D space. The hand movement and finger positions are captured by a laptop camera, and mapped to different sound effects. Each finger controls its own music channel and timbre. Visual effects are used to show the position of the figures and their movements, providing feedback to the players about the process and hand gestures of creating music. I use OpenCV (C++) to track the finger movement, max/msp and Ableton Live to generate sound.
